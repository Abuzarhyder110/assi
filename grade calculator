#Grade Calculator: Create a program that asks the user for their score in different subjects and calculates their overall grade based  on a grading scale stored in a dictionary.

def calculate_grade(scores,grading_scales):
    total_score = sum(scores)
    max_score = sum(grading_scale.values())

    percentage = (total_score / max_score) * 100

    for grade, score_range in grading_scale.items():
        if percentage >= score_range[0]:
          return grade 

  return "F"

def main():
    grading_scale = {
        "A": (90, 100)
        "B": (80, 89)
        "C": (70, 79)
        "D": (60, 69)
}

    subjects = ["Maths" , "Science" , "English"]
    scores  = []
    for subject in subjects:
        score = float(input("f"Enter score for {subject}: "))
        scores.append(score)

    grade = calculate_grade(scores.grading_scales)
    print("Overall Grade:", grade)
