#Word Counter : write a program that reads a sentence and counts the number of times each word appears. Use a dictionary to store the word counts.

def word_counts(sentence):
    words = sentence.split()

    word_counts = {}
    for word in words:
        word = word.strip(",.!?")
        word = word.lower()

        if word in word_counts:
            word_counts[word] += 1
        else:
            word_counts[word] = 1

    return word_counts

sentence = input("Enter a sentence: ")
counts = word-counter(sentence)
print("Word counts:")
for word, count in counts.items():
    print(f"{word}: {count}")
